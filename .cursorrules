# ClawArm Development Rules

## Project Overview
ClawArm is an AI-powered robotic arm control system using OpenClaw + pyAgxArm.
It has three main components:
- `bridge/` — Python FastAPI server wrapping pyAgxArm (the runtime)
- `plugin/` — OpenClaw TypeScript plugin providing agent tools
- `skills/` — OpenClaw skill files for code generation

## Code Style
- Python: follow ruff defaults (E, F, I, W), line length 100
- TypeScript: standard style, ESM imports with .js extensions
- All motion values: joints in radians, positions in meters

## Safety Rules
- NEVER remove or weaken safety checks without explicit approval
- NEVER increase default speed limits above 80%
- NEVER disable safety validation in tests (use mock driver instead)
- ALL new motion commands must pass through SafetyValidator

## Testing
- Run `pytest -q` before committing (uses mock driver, no hardware needed)
- Set `CLAWARM_MOCK=true` when running the bridge server without hardware
- Bridge API tests use httpx AsyncClient with ASGI transport

## Key Conventions
- `motion_status == 0` means motion is COMPLETE (not == 1)
- Mode switch requires 1s delay before AND after
- Robot must be enabled BEFORE switching motion modes
- NERO = 7 DOF, Piper = 6 DOF
